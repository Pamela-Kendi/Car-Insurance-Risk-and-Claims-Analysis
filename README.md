# Car Insurance Risk and Claims Analysis
## Project Overview
An insurance company had its policyholder and claims data spread across different sources, making it hard to track performance and spot trends. To address this, I created a Power BI dashboard that brings the data together into one place.

The dashboard provides:

An overview of policyholder profiles and claim activity

Trends in claim frequency and customer demographic

Key performance indicators for easier monitoring

The work included cleaning and preparing the data, building a simple data model, and using DAX for calculations. The result is an interactive tool that helps stakeholders explore their data more clearly and make informed decisions.

## Project KPI Requirements
- Total Policies
- Total Claim Amount
- Average Claim Amount
- Claim Frequency
- Total Policies by Gender

## Analysis
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

This project involved connecting to the data source - a csv file, and performing necessary data cleaning and transformation steps, such as assigning appropriate data types, replacing values with more descriptive terms, renaming columns, removing duplicates, and deriving new fields like age and age group from the Birth date column.

- DAX & Data Analysis

DAX measures were created to calculate the total number of male and female policyholders, the total number of policies, average claim amounts, and the policy amounts. To dynamically interact and analyze the dashboard, two selected measures were implemented ie; total claim amount and total policies. 

- Reporting  & Visualization

The metrics were analyzed using card visuals and across different categories such as by car year, car make, age group, coverage zone, and the number of kids driving. 

- Filtering and Interactivity

Slicers for total claim amount and total policies were used to filter the dashboard. A button allows users to select the metric they want to analyze.
